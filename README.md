# gofighter_examples

[Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io) client programs using my [Gofighter](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofighter) library.

The library is now complete enough for programs that can e.g. clear Level 3 (and beyond, with a bit of work). I can't publish such solutions, but the B.L.S.H. bots give a reasonable sample of how stuff works.
