# gofighter_examples

[Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io) client programs using my [Gofighter](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofighter) library.

The library is now complete enough to write programs that can (e.g.) clear Level 4. I can't publish such solutions, but the B.L.S.H. bots, the Manual trader, and the Market and Position printers give a reasonable sample of how stuff works.
